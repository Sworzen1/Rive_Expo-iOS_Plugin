## 🌈 Rive

[Rive](https://rive.app/) is a real-time interactive animation tool that allows developers to create and integrate lightweight, high-performance animations into apps, games, and websites. Unlike traditional animations, Rive animations are dynamic and state-driven, enabling smooth transitions and interactions.

## 📝 Description

This Expo app leverages **Rive** for an enhanced user experience, including:

- **Animated Refresh Control**: A smooth and engaging pull-to-refresh animation.
- **Custom Bottom Tabs**: Interactive and dynamic tab navigation with Rive effects.

Built with **React Native, Expo, and Rive**, this project focuses on fluid and visually appealing UI interactions. 🚀

## 📲 Installation & Running the App

1. Install dependencies:

   ```sh
   yarn install
   ```

2. Compile plugin and prebuild app

   ```sh
   yarn prebuild
   ```

3. Start iOS app:

   ```sh
   npx expo run:ios
   ```

### I've created animations myself, they can be found on [my Rive profiil](https://rive.app/@b.sworzen).
